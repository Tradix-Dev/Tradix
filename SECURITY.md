## Security Overview

Tradix is a Chrome extension designed for automated Solana copy trading with enterprise-grade security protocols. This document outlines our comprehensive security measures, vulnerability management, and best practices.

## 🔐 Core Security Features

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP)
- **Strict CSP Implementation**: All inline scripts and styles are blocked
- **Resource Whitelisting**: Only trusted domains are allowed for API calls (CoinGecko API)
- **Nonce-based Script Execution**: Dynamic scripts require cryptographic nonces
- **Frame Ancestors**: Prevents clickjacking attacks via frame restrictions

### 2. Data Encryption & Storage
- **Chrome Storage API**: Leverages Chrome's secure storage mechanisms for local data
- **Local Storage Only**: All data stored locally using chrome.storage.local and chrome.storage.sync
- **No External Storage**: No sensitive data transmitted to external servers
- **Memory Protection**: Sensitive data cleared from memory after use

### 3. API Security
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All API calls require TLS 1.3
- **Single External API**: Only CoinGecko API used for price data
- **External Support**: Support redirects to official Tradix support page
- **Rate Limiting**: API calls throttled to prevent abuse
- **No Sensitive Data**: Only public price data requested from external APIs

### 4. Authentication & Authorization
- **Optional Passcode Protection**: 4-8 character passcode for settings access
- **Local Authentication**: All authentication handled locally
- **Permission Model**: Only storage permission required
- **Access Control**: Settings protection through passcode system

## 🛡️ Vulnerability Management
